Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way

Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
Two hundred miles at nightfall
Taken within a day
Thus earning their name
Earning the fame

They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
